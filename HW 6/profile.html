	<h2>Short Story</h2>
	<p>	Once upon a time, there was a dog by the name of Moose. One would think she got her name because she looked like a moose, quite the opposite is true. Moose is a golden retriever. Long, curly ginger fur cascades from her adult form. She loves to play fetch, shocker right? Well, she does, she will chase a ball for hours. That's how she met her best friend. One day at the dog park, Moose was playing fetch with her human. She was having a ball, chasing after other dogs, running around the park, and playing fetch. One time, another dog saw the ball and decided to fetch it herself. Moose was unhappy with this smaller "rat" dog. She snarled and growled until the other dog put her ball down. She snatched it and went running back for another round of fetch. Sadly, Moose felt bad for not inviting the other dog to play so she chased the ball down and ran over to the other dog. 
		"What do you want?" the other dog barked angrily.
		Moose, feeling sorry about her hostility earlier woofed "I'm sorry for being selfish, wanna play fetch?"
		"I guess" the other dog replied sheepishly.
		Moose ran back with the ball to her human, "rat" dog in tow shortly behind her.
		"What's your name?" Moose asked while shuffling around her human in sheer excitement.
		"Izzy, but I'm ornery so they call me the mini terrorist" Izzy, the other dog stated.
		Moose thought to herself, "That's a cool name."
		She then stated "Wanna be my partner in crime?", followed by a devilish wink.
		"woof!" Izzy barked, which is dog for yes, obviously.
		From that day forward, the devilish duo was known as Moose and her lil' Terror.</p>
